                    Recently I moved from Brussels to Lisbon.
                    Coming from the northern hemisphere where I was familiar with the very common plants like Hogweed,
                    Dandelion and trees like Oak, Beech and Birch, most plants encoutered here in the south of Europe
                    where unknown to me.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Carob tree, Rubber fig, Aloe and Agave varieties, Oleander, Giant cane are among those very common
                    plants that I had no name for.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So I set out to make an inventory of plants I didn’t know, and document them progressively.

                <p>
                    Plantzr is a web application, based on the MEAN-stack, that allows to create (and edit) a
                    descriptive card for each plant species I want to document.

                    To be able to upload photo’s directly from the field, I also added a native mobile application.
