                                Recently I moved from Brussels to Lisbon.
                                Coming from the northern hemisphere where I was familiar with the very common plants
                                like
                                Hogweed,
                                Dandelion and trees like Oak, Beech and Birch, most plants encoutered here in the south
                                of
                                Europe
                                where unknown to me.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Carob tree, Rubber fig, Aloe and Agave varieties, Oleander, Giant cane are among those
                                very common plants that I had no name for.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                So I set out to make an inventory of plants I didn’t know, and document them
                                progressively.
                            </p>

                        Plantzr is a web application, based on the MEAN-stack, that allows to create (and edit)
                        a
                        descriptive card for each plant species I want to document.

                    <p>
                        To be able to upload photo’s directly from the field, I also added a native mobile
                        application. <br/>
