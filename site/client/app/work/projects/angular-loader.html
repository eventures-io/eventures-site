                <h1>Angular loader directive</h1>

                <p>
                    The Angular loader directive inserts a css loading animation into the dom when a $http request is started,
                    and removes it again when the response has been received.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The directive has no dependencies, and is fully configurable in a run block.
                    Essential css layout parameters are declared as Sass variables, and can also easily be overridden.
                </p>
                <p>
                   The directive can be installed through Bower, or manually downloaded from Github.
                </p>
